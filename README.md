                              Alien Invasion
                              
Alien Invasion is first of the final three projects from book
Python Crash Course 2ed and as it is a learning project, large parts of
the code were taken from there. 

Using the left and right arrow keys player should navigate player's ship and by
pressing spacebar shoot down all alien ships before they reach down.
At the start players can choose difficulty which will determine initial speed
of alien fleet.
When player shoots down all aliens, new fleet will appear it will move slightly
faster. Shooting faster ships results in getting more score points.
